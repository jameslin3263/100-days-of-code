### **Today's Progress**: Committing, Planning, Setting up shop

I’ve publicly committed to #100DaysOfCode on Twitter

#### Markdown for the Github repo Log

I installed MWeb Lite app on my Macbook to be able to write MarkDown pages for the Github repo. Haven’t tested it yet, but it’s free, so I’ll look into it first, then make a decision about further steps. 

I’ve also installed a Google Drive script that converts Docs to Markdown and emails them to you. It’s been tested and looks very promising. I think it would be easiest for me to document my progress in a Google Doc, then convert it to MarkDown and publish on the Github repo.

### Thoughts

I can actually dive into this for hours unending, which is not what I’m trying to achieve here. This is a medium range project, so after initial push I’d like to stick to one hour a day. I’ve installed a pomodoro timer app on the Macbook to make sure I don’t go beyond the 1 hour limit. I’ll do 2x25 minute sessions every day, with a 5 minute break between them. 

Daily blogging will be done in the last 5 minutes of each day and if I feel like elaborating more about my experience, I may do a longer weekly recap blog post. 

My plan is to get back to the basics of web development and move up from there. First step: Git and Github. 

I have the kindle book Pro Git, which has a very thorough approach towards Git. Tomorrow I would like to read chapter 2 of it, but before I do that, I’m going to run through Github’s own Hello World hands-on tutorial
